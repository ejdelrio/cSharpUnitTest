# cSharpUnitTest
First attempt at c# unit test

Uses xunit test suite to conincide with .NET Core 2.0. The Unit Test package for .NET throws a biuld error.

List of Steps:

1. Create your solution :D

2. Create a project for your code, classes and etc using a .NET Core Console Applicaiton.

3. Write your code? (Not TDD :( )

4. Create a second package in the same solution, using the XUnitTest package for .NET Core.

5. Right Click on the package, click add, and add a reference. Click the project you'd like to test.
  (This adds the project to the test projects namespace)
 
6. Write your tests :D

As for the funcitonality of XUnit Test. There's a still a lot of stuff I'm not too familiar with.
